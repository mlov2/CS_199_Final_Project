# CS_199_Final_Project

My final project will be using ktor to build a web application similar to Goodreads.  I aim to include in my final project a way for users to log books they've read, books they want to read, books they loved, and books they would recommend.  In addition, my final project will work to include pages where users can review, browse, and view recommended books made by other users.
